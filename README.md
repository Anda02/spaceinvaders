When I started this I had little knowledge of programming and no knowledge of C++. I decided that I wanted to 
create a new game base from the Space Invaders game instead of just modifying Space Invaders. I started with
removing many of the lines of codes that spawned in the assets. I removed the invaders and missiles. From there
I added a new asset to create a "star system" then I coded a new level.

I added the assets for planets, a moon, and a star in
and spawned them into the world. I also wanted to make a random new each time I pressed a button to created more variety
for the levels. I added an array which contained a set of random numbers that I plugged into each othe coordinates of
the assets and everytime the player presses the spacebar it jumps the ship to a new random system. Then I added a simple
system that when the player touches a certain planet they get "cargo".

I've learned how to add new objects into the invaderers program as well as the basic structure of how classes work in
C++. I also used arrays and learnedhow the enum class works in order to add new objects into the game. I also learned how random
number generators work and how to implement them in a constantly changing system.
